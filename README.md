# Minecraft speedrunning reset macro

## Description

This is as-multiplatform-as-I-could-make-it Python reset macro for Minecraft speedrunning.Should fully support Windows, Linux with X11 (tested on elementaryOS Hera) and MacOS (tested on Big Sur). Could work on Wayland, but I din't even test it - see additional steps to give it a try. Written for Python 3.6+.

## Versions/Categories covered

Currently covered:

* 1.16 Random seed glitchess
* 1.16 Set seed glitchless
* 1.16 Filtered seed glitchless (using seed from clipboard)
* 1.15 Random seed glitchless
* 1.14 Random seed glitchless

## Additional features

* Renaming RSG worlds based on txt file world counter.

## Default keybinds for Windows

* `Ctrl + m` creates new RSG world, works for 1.14+
* `Ctrl + k` creates new SSG world, works only in 1.16
* `Ctrl + o` creates new FSG world using seed from clipboard, works only in 1.16
* `Ctrl + n` exits current singleplayer world, works for 1.14+
* `Ctrl + /` exits macro gracefully, although good old `Ctrl + c` works as well

Force perch hotkey is disabled by default - see _Optional steps_ on how to enable it on your own risk.

## Default keybinds for Linux

* `Ctrl + m` creates new RSG world, works for 1.14+
* `Ctrl + k` creates new SSG world, works only in 1.16
* `Ctrl + n` exits current singleplayer world, works for 1.14+
* `Ctrl + /` exits macro gracefully, although good old `Ctrl + c` works as well

Force perch hotkey is disabled by default - see _Optional steps_ on how to enable it on your own risk.
FSG generation is disabled on Linux by default. You can set it and try it yourself, but pasting seed from clipboard is affected by [MC-122477](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-122477), causing `ctrl+v` sometimes to input `v` after the pasted contents.

## Default keybinds for MacOS

* `Cmd + u` creates new RSG world, works for 1.14+
* `Cmd + k` creates new SSG world, works only in 1.16
* `Cmd + o` creates new FSG world using seed from clipboard, works only in 1.16
* `Cmd + n` exits current singleplayer world, works for 1.14+
* `Cmd + l` exits macro gracefully, although good old `Ctrl + c` works as well

Force perch hotkey is disabled by default - see _Optional steps_ on how to enable it on your own risk.

## Installation instructions

_Since the macro is written for Python, some steps are troublesome now, might try to correctly package it later_.

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6+ and PIP installed - you can grab Python from [Python's site](https://www.python.org/) or install it through your platform's package manger of choice (probably Chocolatey for Windows, Homebrew for Mac and whatever your distribution's package manager is on Linux).
2. If you have git installed and know how to use it, clone the repo to preferred destination. Otherwise, click the `Code` button on project's page and then `Download ZIP`. After that, unzip it to preferred desitnation.
3. _(Additional step on Linux)_ You need to install packages `scrot` and `python3-tk`. On Debian-based system the command for that is `sudo apt-get install -y scrot python3-tk`
4. Navigate to unzipped/cloned folder in your terminal emulator and run `pip install --user -r requirements.txt` on Windows or `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt` on MacOS/Linux because of  inner workings of `keyboard` module. Can't really do anything about that, if you don't feel comfortable doing so and feel like you know a better solution to adding hotkeys, please make Pull Request or create Issue with resources pointing me in that direction.
5. _(Additional step for MacOS)_ open `Security and Privacy` and give Accessibility and Screen Recording permissions to your terminal emulator - accessibility permission is for keybinds to work, screen recording to detect wheter Minecraft is the window in focus in order not to run macro somewhere random. - If you don't feel comfortable allowing Screen Recording, see **Optional steps** to disable checking actively focused window. Unfortunately, Accessibility permissions is required and I can't do anything with that.
6. Whlie in correct folder in your terminal emulator, run `python main.py` on Windows. On Linux and MacOS you need to run `sudo python3 main.py`, again because of  inner workings of `keyboard` module.
7. Start using macro. ðŸ¤·

## Optional steps

* In order to change hoykeys, change their value in `config.ini` under your platform section - the names should be self-explanatory.
* To disable any of the hotkeys, remove its value in `config.ini` (the part after the `=` sign, so it looks something like this: `ssg_hotkey=`). The macro will warn about missing hotkeys in that case, to disable that change `warn_about_missing_hotkeys` value to `false`.
* If the macro is too fast, change `key_delay_in_miliseconds`  in `config.ini` to something higher, but I wouldn't really recommend anything more than 120.
* If your default open chat key is different than `t`, change `enter_chat_key` in `config.ini `accordingly
* In order to change difficulty macro chooses for new world, set `difficulty` in `config.ini` to desired value. Allowed values are: `easy`, `normal`, `hard`.
* In order to disable naming worlds based on txt file world counter, set `name_worlds` in `config.ini` to `false`. To set world counter value to your current count (e.g. from livesplit), change the number in file corresponding to your MC version (`world_counter_1_14.txt` for 1.14 and 1.15, `world_counter_1_16.txt` for 1.16)

*If you don't want to give Screen Recording permission on MacOS or macro doesn't work on Wayland:*

1. _(Optional step for Wayland users if Xlib fails to install - I don't know if it actually does, but it might ðŸ¤·)_ Remove `python-xlib==0.29; sys_platform == "linux"` line from `requirements.txt` and try to install them again.
2. Change `check_minecraft_window_before_executing_actions` value to `false` in `config.ini`
3. Change `active_minecraft_version` in `config.ini` to whatever version you're currently running and restart macro. You have to do that every time you change version.
